# WasmToBoogie

A formal verification tool for WebAssembly (WASM) programs that translates WASM code to Boogie intermediate verification language.

## Overview

WasmToBoogie is a tool that takes WebAssembly code and its AST as input and generates Boogie code for formal verification. It follows a similar approach to VeriSol but is specifically designed for WASM's unique characteristics:

- Stack-based execution model
- Linear memory
- WASM-specific type system
- Control flow constructs
